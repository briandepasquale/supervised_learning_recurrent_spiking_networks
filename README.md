# Demonstrations of supervised learning using RLS in recurrent spiking networks



Contact depasquale@princeton.edu with problems.

This script will train a network of LIF neurons to perform a oscillation task based on the method described in "Using firing rate dynamics to train recurrent networks of spiking model neurons" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.07620)
